						<h1>Interviews</h1>
						<p class="info">These interviews include the director and lead vetrinarian of PAWS and a friend of mine who was recently in the market for a rescue dog. I have another interview hopefully in the works but couldn't fit it into the time frame (will be adding later).</p>

						<p>The interview with Dr. Kim Sanders was so informative and helpful to my overall project. I learned about a variety of services that were no where on the website, as well as a deep insight into the different audiences they cater to and the primary goals of PAWS. All of this has been very influncial in my research and my brand redesign.</p>
						<img id="cailee-int" src="images/cailee-int.PNG">
						<p>Cailee was a great example of a customer who is looking for an animal to adopt, which is one of the many audiences that PAWS is attempting to reach. I learned about what she enjoyed from other pet adoption websites, as well as what she was looking for beginning her search.</p>
