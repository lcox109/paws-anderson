						<h1>The Design Challenge</h1>
						<p>This Design Challenge template was created by IDEO. Below are the questions posed by IDEO and my answers.</p>
					</header>

					<!-- Text -->
						<section>
							<header>
								<h3>What is the problem you’re trying to solve?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The website for PAWS Anderson County Animal Shelter is not sufficient in providing information or reaching its audience.</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Frame it as a design question.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>How can the website reach it's audience and provide them with important information easily?</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Now, state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Help PAWS reach it's correct audience in order to increase adoptions, donations, volunteers, foster opportunities, and improve the overal quality of the shelter.</p>
							<header>
								<h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Creating a strong brand identity to set PAWS apart and give it's audience a clear vision.</p>
								<p>Creating a separate website for PAWS, apart from the Anderson County site.</p>
								<p>Providing on-brand graphics and media content that clearly defines information, events, and ways to get involved.</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The animal shelter seems to be run by the county, so they probably don't have a huge media budget or anything. Only services the Anderson/Upstate area. Basically run on volunteers, which can lead to inconsisitent service and information.</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>How can I design a website and brand identity for PAWS Anderson County Animal SHelter, that will assist them in reaching potential volunteers, adoptors, funding for the shelter, and enevitably help provide animals a safe and loving home?</p>
