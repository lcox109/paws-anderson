					<p>The Greenville Humane society does an excellent job of keeping a consistent brand identity throughout their website. They have a logo that stands apart from the slew of "cat in dog in house" logos. The color palatte is clearly defined and provides consistency throughout thier website, social media, graphics, and the actual building they are in.</p>
					<p>In terms of website content, the Greenville Humane Society has a clear directory at the top of the page, with easy access to any information a viewer could need. They also have larger buttons throughout the site to direct customers to the correct place for their desired information.</p>

					<p>In a direct comparison between Anderson PAWS and the Greenville Humane Society, we can see how a little bit of design and effort can go a long way in making information easier to digest and more appealing to look at. In turn, the Greenville Humane Society statistics are being read more, and are creating a larger impact.</p>

					<p>Greenville County Animal Care is the equivalent of PAWS in Anderson. They are both non-profit animal shelters run by the county. Both shelters house thier websites as webpages under thier respective county's main websites.</p>
					<p>However, Greenville County Animal Care is an excellent example of how a webpage within a main site can still provide all of the necessary information, showcase a brand, and draw a viewer in. Below you can see a side by side comparison of both webpages.</p>

					<p>On Animal Care's site, the contact information, about, and other important information are all clearly labels on the side with an easy way to get to the information. The site has photos of animals, a friendly logo, and an overall approachable feel.</p>

					<p>After reasearching animal shelters around the area, I dove into retailer sites. The end goal of PAWS is to place animals in loving homes so essentially, they are a retailer of pets. Looking through websites, I landed on Anthropologie for a few reasons. One of the main aspects of this website that make it a success is the lack of "extra stuff". The scroll page with items for sale really only has that. The images take up the majority of the screen with a minimal amount of text. Once you get to the specific item you are looking for, you are shown a variety of images from all angles, and given an easy way to add the item to your cart. The entire experience of using their website is extremely user friendly and simple.</p>
